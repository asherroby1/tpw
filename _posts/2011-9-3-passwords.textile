I’m not a security analyst, but I understand more than the average Joe about things like passwords, entropy and stuff. We hear all the time how important security is and how having unique passwords is the latest thing or having a unique username and password combination is important… WHATEVER! Anyway, I’ve gone to a few sites recently where they only allow A-Z,0-9 as acceptable characters for passwords. It’s hard enough to get a user (from a sys admin point of view) to try to think of a complex password with special characters, etc., let alone when the website decided that the extra characters that make a password strong aren’t allowed.

The sites that do this are surprising, actually. I’m not going to mention them, but at least  two have been banks (to their credit, one bank has since rectified this and my ‘regular’ complex password is now allowed). From my understanding it’s not that difficult to allow special characters in passwords… restricting the number of characters is a bit like in the ‘olden days’ of the web when website used to say ‘best viewed in ie6′ or some rubbish. Anyway, now I have to think of a phrase that is easy to remember but can only contain normal characters and numbers… Irritating.
